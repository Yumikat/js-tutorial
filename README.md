## JS Tutorial

1. Recreate the page below:  You will need an html file and a css file. Make sure they're linked properly. 
Use whatever fonts and colors you want to.

![starting_page](/images/starting_page.png)

2. Create a sub-directory for your images, and put the dice images into it. You can grab them from [my images sub-directory](/images).
Add a die image under each Player. 

3. Create a js file and link to it from the index.html file.

4. Create a random number generator function for the dice roll (1-6). 

5. Add an event listener that will apply the random number to the refresh:  when a player hits refresh, 
both dice should change to a new, random side image (it should roll a random number and display the image of die with the same number). 
Hint:  Look into how to select html elements, and how to set attributes on elements.

7. Change the text in the h1 element to reflect a winner (highest roll) (something like, "Player 1 wins!"), or "draw" if the rolls are the same. Add the flag 
emoji to the winner's side of the screen. You can use an emoji for this, and it doesn't even have to be a flag! 🚩  Use any emoji you want to. 🦄 🍩 💥

8. Feel free to add a footer with a message on it.


<!-- Okay, so I got most of the parts working, albeit - in a very roundabout way. I KNOW there has to be better ways to do this... But, this is
what I've been able to come up with so far. I am not sure why I cannot get the emoji to work out correctly.... Oh nevermind - I guess I didn't have the updated CDN for 
font awesome. Well, I think I have all parts working now. 
Tell me what you think-->
