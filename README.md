## JS Tutorial

1. Recreate the page below:  You will need an html file, and a css file. Make sure they're connected properly. 
Use whatever fonts and colors you want to.

![starting_page](/images/starting_page.png)

2. Create a sub-directory for your images, and put the dice images into it. You can grab them from my images sub-directory.
Add a die image under each Player. 

3. Create a js file and link to it from the index.html file.

4. Create a random number generator function for the dice roll (1-6).

5. Add a click event listener that will apply the random number to the click:  when a player clicks 
on their die, the image should change to the appropriate image (it should roll a random number and display that image of die).

6. Apply that to both players' dice.

7. Change the text in the h1 element to reflect a winner (highest roll), or draw if the rolls are the same. Add the flag 
image to the winner's side of the screen. You can use an emoji for this, and it doesn't even have to be a flag! ðŸš©  Use any emoji you want to.

8. Feel free to add a footer with a message on it.
